# DNS records across providers

This repo contains Terraform (or Tofu) modules to create DNS records the same way for a variety of hosted DNS providers.

Currently, the modules support Cloudflare, Scaleway and OVH for A, CNAME, MX, SRV and TXT record types.

Feel free to contribute additional modules for unimplemented record types or new hosted DNS providers.
